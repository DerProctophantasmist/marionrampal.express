#### Beneath the skies of a reinvented New Orleans, Marion Rampal has carved simple and searing songs. Betrayed love, tempest, uprising, this music is made of the deep blue that bathes the Louisiana Bayou, an expression of the many sounds and rhythms of the Delta.

The singular melodies of Main Blue were composed during a voyage across the U.S. mainland, shaped by shared memories and the soul of the land. Inspired by the mischievous tongues of the Cajuns and the French Créoles, Marion created her own language of the sunken hearts, a blend of half-forgotten vocables flowing down the river of Time like an undiscovered Mississipi. Vivacious and untamed, Marion's voice explores the continuum between tradition and invention, heady melodies and improvisation, from contained emotions to a brazenly Soul exuberance. 

Fairy drummer  Anne Paceo - 2016 french Jazz Victories' Artist of the Year - and Rhodes-Chief Pierre-François Blanchard fuel the fire with potent grooviness, drawing from an implacable surge from the deep past. 

Main Blue is an anthem to Blues as an emotional highway, and an unlikely crossroads of complementary inspirations : the tale of a time when songs, tongues and rhythms flew down rivers and crossed the ocean.
