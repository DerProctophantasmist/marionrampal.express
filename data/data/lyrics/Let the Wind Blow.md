#### Let the Wind Blow

Lord Lord
Here’s a lonely sound
Lord
Here’s a lonely sound
Lord
While I walk my ground
Lord Lord
Tell me ‘bout the wind
Lord
Whisper ‘bout the wind
Lord
Where it’s heading at
For we’re wild as it is
We’re free as it is
We come as it comes
And we go as it goes
Once we’ve learned 
To simply sit there
Moaning
Knowing that the Wind blows everywhere


Let the Wind blow everywhere
Let the Wind blow 
Let the Wind blow everywhere


Fathers
Mothers
Sons and
Daughters
Cling to the good word
Cling to the good word
For the Wind tells about the sweet things
And it tells about the terrible ones
The Wind was there long before
Our skins could ever feel its kisses
The Wind is a blind and silent witness
And it blows ‘round the soul
It blows there and everywhere


Lord Lord
Let it blow
Let it go wild or whisper low
Lord Lord
Let it blow
That is all we’ll ever know
