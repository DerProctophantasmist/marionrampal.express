#### 5PM Song

Low was the tide
Oh but high was the sun
Towering up under heaven
I took a turn on the merry-go-round
Though I acted as if it was over

Low sank the sun
And up rose the tide
I heard a theme in the air
Then every clock stopped 
For a delicious while
And it went back to spinning for ever
It was there
Coming on
In a rather good tone

Whoever comes to this
Knows it’s not his to keep
Songs are the wishes
You dare make out loud 

So what shall I do
With this beautiful lie?
Am I the mold or the maker?
You can sit with the muse
But don’t look in her eye
As you gather the whispers that matter
Nothing less
And nothing more
Than what it takes to grow a song 

Whoever’s given this
Knows it’s not his to keep
Songs are the wishes
You dare make out loud
