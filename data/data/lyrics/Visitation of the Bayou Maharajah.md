#### Visitation of the Bayou Maharajah 
*To James Booker*


Baby baby
How everyone adores to be called Baby by&nbsp;you
Baby baby
At the crossroads of my dreams and&nbsp;fears 
I see you
Where the lights turn low
And we meet all the crawling creatures of&nbsp;the&nbsp;groove
At this joint 
At the corner of this street and another and&nbsp;another
Baby baby
I heard that you've heard that she&nbsp;knew that you&nbsp;knew a guy who knew about the&nbsp;meaning of this BLUES
it's YOUR THING THAT YOU DO
baby 
And now you tell me:
Is it worth a visit to the Big&nbsp;Family
Or are we better off now 
Swimming in our own special&nbsp;sauce ?
